      Among the biggest threats to all species of bears is habitat loss, especially from logging, agriculture, and growing human populations.
       Habitat loss reduces the amount of area bears have to hunt and means theyâ€™re increasingly coming into contact with humans,
        which can lead to human-wildlife conflict.
       Bears are killed out of concern for human safety or in retaliation for hunting livestock or crop-raiding.
      Some species of bears, including Asiatic black bears and sun bears, are also threatened by the illegal wildlife trade.
       Bear bile, which is produced in the gall bladder, is an important ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine.
        Asiatic black bears and sun bears may be poached for their gall bladders, paws, skins, and other parts.
         Sometimes American black bears are also targeted for the same reasons.</p>
